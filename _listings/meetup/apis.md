- name: Meetup - WebSocket Photo Stream
  x-api-slug: 2photos-ws
  description: |-
    For browsers that support it, [WebSockets](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/) is a more
    efficient alternative to the long-polling stream. This is a **push only** endpoint and will discard
    any messages received from the client after the socket is open.

    Because browser support for WebSockets is limited, we recommend that you consume this stream
    through the [must.js](https://github.com/meetup/must.js#readme) client, which can fallback to long-polling.
